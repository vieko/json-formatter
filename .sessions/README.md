# Sessions Directory Pattern

This directory implements the **Sessions Directory Pattern** for working with AI coding agents like Claude Code.

## What is this?

The Sessions Directory Pattern creates continuity across sessions with stateless AI agents. Instead of the agent trying to remember context, you maintain a living document that gets read at the start of each session and updated at the end.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start a Session

Use the slash command:
```
/start-session
```

Or prompt Claude directly:
> "Read .sessions/index.md and report when ready. Summarize the current state and ask what I want to work on."

### 2. Work Together

As you work, document important decisions, architecture choices, and progress:
> "Add this to .sessions/index.md under Current State"
> "Document this API decision in .sessions/"

### 3. End the Session

**End frequently** (every 20-30 minutes is fine). Think of it like saving your game - save often!

Use the slash command:
```
/end-session
```

Or prompt Claude directly:
> "Update .sessions/index.md with what we accomplished this session. Include today's date, what we built, any decisions made, and next priorities. Then commit the changes."

## Slash Commands

This setup includes four slash commands for Claude Code:

### `/start-session`
Reads your session context and gets you oriented. Claude will:
- Load `.sessions/index.md`
- Summarize current state
- Ask what you want to work on

### `/end-session`
Updates your session context with what happened. Claude will:
- Document accomplishments
- Record decisions and blockers
- Set next session priorities
- Commit the changes

### `/document <topic>`
Creates topic-specific documentation as your project grows. Claude will:
- Create `.sessions/docs/` folder (first time only)
- Create or update `.sessions/docs/<topic>.md`
- Ask what should be documented
- Structure it with clear headings and context

**Use this when:** You have architectural decisions, API patterns, testing strategies, or other deep context worth its own document.

### `/archive-session`
Archives completed work to keep your context file clean. Claude will:
- Move finished notes to `.sessions/archive/`
- Clean up completed items from index.md

---

## Conversational Prompts

Prefer typing to slash commands? Here are copy-paste prompts for each step:

### Starting a Session
```
Read .sessions/index.md and report when ready.

Summarize:
- Current state
- Recent work
- Next priorities

Then ask what I want to work on this session.
```

### During a Session
```
Document this in .sessions/ under [section name]
```

```
Add this decision to .sessions/index.md: [your note]
```

### Ending a Session
```
Update .sessions/index.md with what we accomplished this session.

Include:
- Today's date
- What we built/fixed/decided
- Any blockers or open questions
- Next session priorities

Then commit the changes with a descriptive message.
```

### Archiving Work
```
Review completed work in .sessions/ and archive it.

Move finished session notes to .sessions/archive/ organized by date or topic.
Clean up .sessions/index.md by removing completed items.
```

## Tips

1. **End sessions frequently** - Sessions can be 20-30 minutes. Think of `/end-session` like saving your game - save often. It's better to end and start fresh than to keep a session open all day.

2. **Update as you go** - Don't wait until the end. Document decisions as you make them.

3. **Be specific** - "Fixed auth bug" is less useful than "Fixed token refresh race condition in AuthProvider"

4. **Track blockers** - Note what's blocking progress so the next session can pick up smoothly

5. **Commit often** - Each session should have at least one commit updating `.sessions/index.md`

6. **Archive completed work** - Once a feature is done, move detailed notes to `.sessions/archive/` to keep your index file scannable

---

## Customizing

This structure is a starting point. Adapt it to your needs:

- Add topic-specific docs (`.sessions/architecture.md`, `.sessions/api-decisions.md`)
- Create templates for recurring documentation
- Structure the archive however makes sense for your project
- Modify slash commands in `.claude/commands/` to match your workflow

---

## Why This Works

AI coding agents are stateless - they don't remember previous sessions. The Sessions Directory Pattern solves this by:

1. **Externalizing memory** - Context lives in files, not the agent's "memory"
2. **Progressive documentation** - You document as you build, not after
3. **Continuity across sessions** - Each session starts with full context
4. **Proof of decisions** - Everything is written down and committed
